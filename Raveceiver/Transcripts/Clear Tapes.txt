Some receivers are getting a thought of, quote on quote "Ravenfield Sex Mod", to be the sole reason to live..

This is a lie.. Receivers, no. Everybody knows this shit is made up.
Please, get normal.

-- Alchemy Arms Spectre --

Well, uhh.. That gun.. You're currently using.. ughh ahh..
Alright yeah. So that gun. Is called the "Alchemy Arms Spectre".

Its a semi-automatic pistol, with safeties similar to the Colt M1911.
And well yeah.. Its basically a uhh, combined designs of the M1911 and the Glock.

I know some of you will despise the design or just look cursed or something...
But oh well, atleast you have the "Safest Glock In The Market".

And uhh.. Yeah.. That's it..

Ahh oh my god, yeah I think that's it for this gun..

-- Colt Python --

Its a revolver.. A double action revolver.
Yeah. That gun in your hand is the "Colt Python".

Well it was y'know iconic aswell. Used in some games and stuff.
And pretty much you operate it how you operate most of the revolvers out there, ehh...
Yeah, that's it.. 

I'm not a gun nerd though. I just wanna get paid..

Ravenfield community has been the greatest? Is it?

Well the answer is undecided since its community members are, well..
Have been coping alot with the dangerous media, and this causes mixed results.

Some are kind, some are bad, some are.. Un-identified.

The community is still in the lower gap of the "Based Gaming Communities".
Well why's that? Ehh well because, there is alot of children in this game.

And typically ravenfield is rated "E". I guess... Or maybe not.
Most receivers who are from this community mostly say is not to visit this community.
Well, they are right and some are wrong.

You see.. There is just a short answer for that.
Its just the nature of gaming communities.

The ravenfield modders are one of the pillars of this game's community.
Since ravenfield relies on mods, always.

But modders.. Don't last long, ehh well the answer for that is already self-explanatory.
Well uhh.. Mostly the answers for that they probably need to focus on their life more for living.
Or maybe school overrunned their time, since some ravenfield modders are students.

Or maybe.. Its time to move on, after hearing or maybe seeing how ravenfield community members act..

Well, according to the retire log of ravenfield modders. That some of the modders.. Like 45% of it.
Has the same reason as what I stated.

If we we're to guess that ravenfield community does toxic or crazy stuff, because of the bad media.
Lies, Awful influences, etchetera..

And now.. Look what it did. Most of the ravenfield community are trapped inside their never ending dream.
