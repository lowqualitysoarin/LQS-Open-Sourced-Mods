## Mission Start ##

Uh, hello?
Hey uh purple guy can you hear me?
Alright, *Clears Throat*


Alright so lets get straight to the point.
So your mission here is to destroy all of the active objectives present in this area.

You can press your [Right Bracket] key to open up your navigator.
And it should lead you on one of those active objectives.

And when you got on one of those objectives, uh you sabotage them.
And once your done, you get the hell outta there before they even bother to investigate it.

And when you finally destroyed all of the given objectives.

You shoot any hostiles in sight.
And don't let them escape.


But for now.
Try keeping your head down and try not to attract too much attention, and you should be all fine.
And yeah, I guess that's pretty much it.


Oh, wait.
Uh almost forgot to mention.

Last but not the least.
Try not to get hit.

And.. Good luck out there.

I believe in you.

I'll talk to you soon.
